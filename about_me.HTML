    <p class="writing">    Hi, I'm Hudson Cole. I was born in Oakland, California in 2006. I live in two houses,
    one in Oakland and one in Castro Valley. I go to school in Piedmont since
    my mom works there. I have a sister and a step-brother. I have four moms
    because my parents are lesbian and divorced. I used to have 4 cats but they
    all died. I have 3 dogs, Lola, Pepper, and Domino. I like to play video games like Valorant.
    I like to hang out with my friends. I also likes to play sports such as soccer. I
    like food like pizza and sushi.
